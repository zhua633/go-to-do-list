# go-to-do-list

Do you ever feel the instant dopamine reward pleasures when you level up in a game? That was my recent experience with Animal Crossing in the past month ðŸ¤ª. 

After spending an ungodly amount of hours in the game, that's when I realised this time could be better dedicated to levelling up in the real life. 

This is the intention behind this to-do-list project, apart from levelling up in Golang since I suck at it, but also to tweak the common personal project idea slightly to bring a little more productivity and joy to your life âœ¨.

# Features 
1. Completion bar
The player gets to set up daily to-do items that is modifiable throughout the day. Each time a task is completed, the completed status is updated to something like 12% for easy visualization.

2. Character exp bar
The player can set the nature of each task to specific qualities such as (*wisdom*) (*health*) (*relationship*) (*kindness*). These characteristics are also customizable. 
Each time a task is completed, the player character will get an exp point towards generic levelling up, and also contributes to one point in the specific category. 

3. Home Page
The player character is in the center of the home page, along with qualities, levels, daily to-do-list, yearly goals. Visualization of goals helps to give a little boost of motivation
